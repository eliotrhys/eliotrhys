- 👋 Hi, I’m @eliotrhys!
- 👀 I’ve been a UX/UI designer and Front End Dev for 4 years
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React (Next.js) and Python (Django)
- 💞️ I’m open to new work opportunities!

I'm slowly updating this neglected Github page - I've been working for the past several years for agencies and all my best work is Top SecretTM! But check out my latest project www.triviamoji.com for a recent idea, and keep your eyes peeled for more updates coming soon!
